# wallhaven
21年的时候还在学校，室友发现了wallhaven这个网站，因为太多精美好看又喜欢的壁纸一张张保存太慢太累了，于是我干脆自学帮他写一个爬虫，后来网站上不去之后脚本就没再用过了。最近发现了DrissionPage这个库，感觉挺不错的，于是想把这个老脚本重写翻写一下练练手，这个老脚本就扔这里不再动了。
In 2021, when I was still in school, my roommate discovered the website wallhaven. Since there were so many beautiful wallpapers that we liked, saving them one by one was too slow and tiring. So, I decided to self-study and write a crawler to help him. Later, when the website became inaccessible, the script was no longer used. Recently, I discovered the library DrissionPage, which seems quite good. Therefore, I want to rewrite and rewrite this old script to practice. This old script will be left here and no longer used.
